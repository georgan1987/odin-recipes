# odin-recipes
This simple webpage was created during the Foundation Course on the Odin Project.
In this page, you can find three traditional greek food recipes (Moussaka, Galaktoboureko and Souvlaki)

During this assignment, we learned how to fill out the HTML Boilerplate, create directory and files in the terminal,
input headers, paragraphs, lists (ordered and unordered), images and links.

I also tried to organize a clean code, so it could be easily readable and understandable to every user.

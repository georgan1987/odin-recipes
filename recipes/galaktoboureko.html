        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To make this Galaktoboureko recipe, start by preparing the syrup. <br> Into a small pan add the sugar, the water and lemon peel, cinammon stick and lemon and bring to the boil. <br> Let it boil just until the sugar has dissolved. Remove the pan from the stove, add the honey and stir.<br> Leave the syrup aside to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Make your egg whites to meringues and fold them in the galaktoboureko custard mixture.<br> In most recipes, the eggs are added whole towards the end, but with this Galaktoboureko recipe the eggs <br> are beaten into meringues and combined in the semolina based cream.</li>
            <li>Add the semolina slowly to the warm milk and whisk constantly to prevent it from forming lumps!</li>
            <li>Make sure the mixture is cool when folding in your meringues so they don’t curdle.<br> When preparing your custard you will be heating up your milk, sugar, vanilla and semolina to get the ingredients to combine and form a cream. <br>Before folding in the meringues make sure the custard mixture has cooled down to 50C/120F or until warm to touch else your eggs may curdle!</li>
            <li>Pour into a saucepan the milk, the cream and 120g of the sugar, and bring to the boil.<br> (Don’t whisk the mixture. The sugar at the bottom of the pan protects the milk from burning.) <br>As soon as it comes to the boil and heats up slowly add the semolina and the vanilla extract, <br>whilst whisking. Turn the heat down to medium heat and whisk constantly until the mixture becomes creamy. <br> Remove the pan from the stove, add a knob of butter and fold. <br>Let it cool down while you are preparing the remaining steps, until warm (50c / 120F), else your mix will curdle when you fold in the eggs. <br>Just remember to whisk it once in a while.</li>
            <li>Divide the eggs into yolks and whites. In most traditional Greek recipes, the eggs are added whole towards the end,<br> but with this Galaktoboureko recipe the eggs are beaten into meringues and combined in the semolina based cream.<br> This is the secret to a more fluffy and creamy custard and to avoid the egg-y smell, which can ruin the flavour of your Galaktoboureko.</li>
            <li>Place the egg whites and 50g sugar in a mixing bowl. Make sure your egg whites, bowl and whisk attachment/s are free of any water. <br>Use an electric mixer or electric hand beaters to whisk the egg whites and sugar until the mixture is very thick and glossy, <br> all the sugar has dissolved and a long trailing peak forms when the whisk is lifted (meringues). Set aside.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, whisk the yolks and 50g of sugar, until the mixture is thick and foamy. This should take about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>With a spatula add 1/4 of the meringues into the egg yolks-sugar mixture and blend with light circular movement from the bottom up.<br> Gradually add all the meringues into the mixture and fold.</li>
            <li>Fold together the two mixtures, from step 3 and step 7 and set aside.</li>
            <li>For this Galaktoboureko recipe, you need a large baking tray, approx. 25x32cm. Melt 230g of butter (low heat) and butter the bottom and sides of the tray.<br> Remove the phyllo roll from the plastic sleeve. You will use 6 sheets of phyllo for the bottom of the Galaktoboureko.</li>
            <li>Begin by layering the sheets one by one on the bottom of the tray, making sure to sprinkle each one thoroughly with melted butter. <br>Layer four sheets of phyllo so that they extend half in the pan and half out of the pan horizontally and vertically and two more in the middle.</li>
            <li>Tip in the custard, smoothing the surface with a spatula and fold the phyllo sheet flaps over the custard. Sprinkle with melted butter.</li>
            <li>Add 6 sheets on top, sprinkling each sheet with melted butter. With a knife trim some of the excessive phyllo and use your pastry brush to help you turn the phyllo inwards, <br>towards the bottom of the pan to seal the galaktoboureko.Add 6 sheets on top, sprinkling each sheet with melted butter.<br> With a knife trim some of the excessive phyllo and use your pastry brush to help you turn the phyllo inwards, towards the bottom of the pan to seal the galaktoboureko.</li>
            <li>Scar the top of the Galaktoboureko in pieces with a sharp knife. Cut down until the knife reaches the cream.</li>
            <li>Pour over the remaining butter. Sprinkle with a little bit of water.</li>
            <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 160C for 60 to 75 minutes until the phyllo is crisp and golden.</li>
            <li>As soon as the Galaktoboureko is ready, ladle slowly the cold syrup over the pastry. (Hot galaktoboureko, cold syrup)</li>
            <li>Serve after the syrup is absorbed. Enjoy!</li>

        <h2>Souvlaki (Greek: σουβλάκι), is a popular Greek fast food consisting of small pieces of meat and sometimes vegetables grilled on a skewer.</h2>

        It is usually eaten straight off the skewer while still hot. <br>It can be served with or inside of a rolled pita, typically with lemon, sauces, vegetables such as sliced tomato and onion, and fried potatoes as a side.<br> The meat usually used in Greece and Cyprus is pork, although chicken, beef, and lamb may also be used there and elsewhere.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare this chicken souvlaki recipe, start by preparing the marinade. <br>
                Cut the chicken breasts into 2-3 cm pieces and place them in a large bowl, along with all the marinade ingredients.<br>
                 Use your hands to mix really well, cover with plastic wrap and put in the fridge for 30-60 minutes.</li>
            <li>In the meantime prepare the tzatziki sauce for the chicken souvlaki. <br>
                Pour in a blender the olive oil and grated garlic and blend until combined.<br>
                 Remove the skin and the seeds of the cucumber and grate it into a large bowl. <br>
                 Season with salt and pepper and leave aside for 10 minutes. <br>
                 Wrap the grated cucumber in a towel and squeeze, in order to get rid of the excess water.<br>
                  In a bowl, add the cucumber, the blended garlic and oil, the yogurt, 1-2 tbsps of red wine vinegar, <br>
                  a pinch of salt and blend, until the ingredients are combined. Store the tzatziki sauce in the fridge and always serve cold.<br>
                  </li>
            <li>To assemble the chicken souvlaki (skewers), cut the wooden skewers to fit your griddle pan and soak them in water. <br>
                (This will prevent them from burning.) Thread the chicken pieces, comfortably, on the skewers.</li>
            <li>Preheat a grill or griddle pan on a high heat. Cook the chicken souvlaki (skewers) for about 8 to 10 minutes,<br>
                turning occasionally, until nicely coloured on all sides and cooked through.</li>
            <li>While your chicken souvlaki is cooking, prepare the pita breads. Preheat the oven to 250C. <br>
                Use a cooking brush to oil the pita breads on both sides and season with salt and oregano. <br>
                Place a large oven tray (upside down) at the bottom of the oven and place the pita breads on top of the tray.|
                <br> Bake for 2 minutes. (Alternatively you can use a griddle pan or a grill.)</li>
            <li>To serve the chicken souvlaki (skewers), slice 2 red onions and place on a platter; <br>
                 top with the chicken souvlaki (skewers), drizzle with some extra virgin olive oil and a good squeeze of lemon juice. <br>
                  Serve while still warm with some pita breads and tzatziki sauce. You can also serve the chicken souvlaki (skewers) wrapped, like a sandwich. <br> 
                  Spread some tzatziki sauce on the pita breads and top it with the chicken souvlaki (skewers), sliced onions, tomatoes and fried potatoes and wrap.
                  <br> Enjoy!</li>
